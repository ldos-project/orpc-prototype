## ORPC and OQueue prototype

This project is a prototype for ORPC and OQueues. It is implemented entirely in Linux user-space and demonstrates the
framework and how it is used. The code here will hopefully be portable to kernel-space in a useful way, but it is
unlikely to be exactly as written here.
